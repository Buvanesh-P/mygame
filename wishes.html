      <p class="py-6">
       You collected 24 sparkling stars, completing your 24th year…and now you’re stepping into 25, shining brighter than ever. ✨💫
       </p>

<p class="py-6">Just like the sun—the biggest star of all—you gathered even more stars and made my world glow with your light.
There were ups, downs, and everything in between… but you stayed.
And for that, my heart is endlessly grateful. ❤️
</p>
      <p class="py-6">
I can proudly say this now:
I have a woman who is there for me in every moment—
when I’m happy, when I’m low, when I need support, strength,
or just someone to understand without judgment.
</p>    
      <p class="py-6">
Before you, I used to throw my thoughts into the universe, hoping someone would hear…
But now, I have you.
You’re my safe place. My peace. My favorite person.
</p>
      <p class="py-6">
Thank you for being here with me.
Stay happy, stay healthy…
and keep shining. ✨💖.
